The project involves finding the most optimal path between two cities considering all the hueristics. 

It is implmented in Java by considering every city/point as a node in the graph. The object node also stores any heuristic value available.

Once the graph is created,the program finds the shortest path along with the pathcost using one of these algorithms : BFS, DFS, UCS and A*.
